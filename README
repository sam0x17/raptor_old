RAPTOR - Rapid Three-dimensional Orientation Resolver

RAPTOR is a novel 3D pipeline for inferring the 3D distance and orientation 
(pose) of known classes of rigid objects from 2D image data.


currently only runs on linux

prerequisites -- first run this in a terminal:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install default-jre python blender


current features:
at the moment the evaluation code is being rewritten so right now it is
only possible to generate training data. The old version of RAPTOR
(available in old_src) does contain an old version of planA. The
preliminary results referenced in the technical report were generated
using this old version, however once the new infrastructure is finished,
I will re-run these tests because in the first version there were some
flaws that likely contributed to the level of error I observed.

Since the training data has to accomodate all 3 pipeline variants, there
are many components to each training instance, and no single pipeline 
variant uses all of these components. 

Currently each training instance consists of the following information:
distance from camera (output)
rotation_x, rotation_y, rotation_z (output)
3D covariance matrix from 3D model (output / reference)
raw pixels for rendered image (input)
resized and automatically cropped 128x128 version of rendered image (input)
scaling factors (from resizing) (input)
crop factors (proportion by which each edge was cropped) (input)
2D covariance matrix from rendered image (input)


To generate training data:
./gen_training.sh 1 1000

note: once output stops, you will need to use CTRL+C to quit the script
manually.

note: it is unnecessary to run ./build.sh since this is automatically called
by all the other scripts.

this will generate 1000 training instances in the bin/data folder (first
argument specifies the number of the first instance to be created, second
argument specifies the number of the last instance to be created)

a training data compilation script is also underway that will combine all
of the generated training data into a single file that RAPTOR will seek
through as needed. At the moment this script merely parses through the
existing training data and outputs some useful statistics.

to run the training data compilation script (after generating training data):
./test_compile_training.sh

this should load all the data in your bin/data directory and print statistics
